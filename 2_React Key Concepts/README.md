# README

Some chapters are omitted due to their lack of applicability and a time shortage.

These notes aim to:

- Summarize the chapters by condensing and getting rid of unnecessary info
- Provide commentaries that represent my understanding of exemplified code
- Reorganize content within chapters in the way that makes the most sense to me
- Amend book descriptions that can be more detailed by adding more examples

These notes do NOT aim to:

- Replace the textbook snippets with my own (may be incorrect/reflect the wrong info)
- Create a new application with all the exemplified code (too time-consuming)
- Merely rephrase the book without providing additional insights (does not reinforce learning)
